# Python Scripts for Cybersecurity

This folder contains Python scripts I wrote during my Blue Team training journey.

## Scripts:
- `password_generator.py`: Generate strong passwords
- `log_parser.py`: Search logs for alert keywords
- `port_scanner.py`: Simple socket-based scanner

Each script includes usage instructions and comments.
