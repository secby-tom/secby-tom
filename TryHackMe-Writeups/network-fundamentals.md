## 🧠 Section Overview

This section introduced the **core concepts of networking**, which are essential in both cybersecurity analysis and defensive security roles. I learned how computers communicate, how networks are structured, and how data moves across the internet — all through engaging, hands-on rooms.

## 🧩 Rooms Covered

### 🔹 1. What is Networking?
- What a network is and why we need them
- Difference between LAN, WAN, and the Internet
- IP addresses, DNS, and how data is routed

### 🔹 2. Introduction to LAN
- What a LAN is and how it differs from WAN
- LAN structure, speed, and typical setups
- Basics of local device communication

### 🔹 3. Networking Devices
- Common devices in a network: Router, Switch, Access Point, Firewall
- Role of each device in routing, switching, and securing traffic
- Physical and logical layouts (topologies)

### 🔹 4. The OSI Model
- The 7 layers explained with real-world examples
- How each layer works (from application to physical)
- Where common protocols (HTTP, IP, TCP) fall in the model

### 🔹 5. Packets and Frames
- Difference between Layer 2 (Frames) and Layer 3 (Packets)
- MAC vs IP addressing
- How encapsulation works: data is wrapped with headers at each layer
- Prepares for packet sniffing and log analysis

### 🔹 6. Extending Your Network
- How to expand and interconnect networks
- IP addressing, subnetting basics
- Introduction to NAT, DHCP, and private/public IPs
- Key networking terms used in enterprise environments

## 📚 Key Concepts Learned

- LAN vs WAN vs Internet
- OSI Model and protocol layers
- Network device roles and traffic flow
- Packet and frame structure
- IP vs MAC addresses
- Subnetting and extending networks

---

## 🛠️ Tools Mentioned

- Concepts prepare for using:
  - Wireshark (packet analysis)
  - TCPDump
  - ipconfig / ifconfig / ping / traceroute
  - Basic firewall logic

---

## ✅ My Takeaways

- A **deep understanding of the OSI model** is essential for threat analysis and traffic inspection.
- Understanding **packets and frames** will help me work with tools like **Wireshark** and analyze suspicious traffic.
- The difference between **IP and MAC addressing** is crucial when tracking threat origins.
- Learning about **LAN structure and subnetting** is foundational for both blue team defense and red team simulations.

## 🧠 Personal Reflection

Before this section, networking felt like a “black box.” Now I understand **how devices communicate**, **how the internet actually works**, and **how attackers exploit misconfigured networks** — which is exactly what I’ll learn to detect and prevent as a Blue Teamer.
